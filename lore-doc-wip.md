## Current True Skill Levels and Dampened Levels 

(#true-skill-levels)  

"Dampened Levels" refer to the effects of the **Vanguard's Core** #vanguard-core

| **Skill**                  | **True Level**           | **Dampened Level** | **Notes**                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Skill Mastery Calculations (aka. Leveling Up)

(#leveling-up)  

### Calculating Experience for Gatz with the Vanguard’s Core Dampener

#### Step 1: Determine Base Experience Gain

(#base-experience-gain)  

Each cieli, experience gain for skills depends on the following factors:

1. **Actions Taken**:
   - Gatz must engage in activities relevant to the skill. For example:
     - Combat increases **Martial Prowess**, **Tactical Combat**, and **Endurance**.
     - Observational and investigative actions contribute to **Situational Awareness**.
     - Magic use influences **Fire Magic**.

2. **Effort Intensity**:
   - High-risk situations or extraordinary accomplishments (e.g., Coldspire trials) grant significant experience boosts compared to mundane tasks.

3. **Cieli Activity Type**:
   - **Active combat or intense use**: 3%-5% progression toward the next mastery level.
   - **Training or moderate use**: 1%-2% progression.
   - **Passive activity**: Minimal or no progression.

---

#### Step 2: Apply the Dampener

(#apply-dampener)  

The Vanguard’s Core dampens Gatz’s skills by three mastery levels for all except **Situational Awareness**. This introduces two effects:

1. **Skill Cap**:
   - Progression cannot exceed the dampened level’s maximum until the dampener is removed.
     - *Example*: A skill dampened to Competent will stop progressing once it reaches 100% toward Adept, even though the true level remains higher.

2. **Experience Multiplier**:
   - Training under the dampener boosts progression rates by **1.5x the base growth**.
     - This reflects the added difficulty of pushing against the seal.

---

#### Step 3: Update Mastery Levels After Each Cieli

(#update-mastery-levels)  

1. **Calculate Dampened Progression**:
   - Multiply the base growth percentage by **1.5x**.
     - *Example*: If Gatz earns 2% progress in **Martial Prowess** during a combat-heavy cieli, the effective gain with the dampener is 3%.

2. **Apply Dampened Cap**:
   - If the dampened cap is reached, progression is stockpiled but does not visibly increase until the dampener is removed.

3. **Track True Progression**:
   - Behind the scenes, add the actual experience earned to Gatz’s true mastery level.

---

### Dampener Notes

(#dampener-notes)  

- **When Dampener is Removed**:
  - The stored experience is applied immediately to the true skill levels, reflecting the hidden growth while training under the dampener.

- **Extraordinary Circumstances**:
  - Unique trials or events (e.g., the Coldspire) grant larger progression boosts (e.g., 5%-10% base growth for elite feats). The dampener’s multiplier applies to these as well.

---

## Title: Vanguard of the Aegis

(#vanguard-of-the-aegis, #vanguard-title, #coldspire-title)  

### Passive Skill: "Legendary Aura: Unshakable Presence"

(#legendary-aura, #passive-skill, #unshakable-presence, #skill)  

This aura imposes the following effects on opponents whose relevant defensive mastery level is less than the Vanguard of the Aegis’ offensive mastery level:

1. **Fractured Will**
   - Opponents suffer a **-3 penalty to all rolls** as their confidence and focus falter under the Vanguard’s overwhelming aura.

2. **Elemental Instability**
   - Opponents with elemental affinities experience **unintended magical fluctuations**, weakening their control over spells or imbuements. **Rolls involving elemental magic suffer a -3 penalty.**

3. **Weakened Stamina**
   - The oppressive weight of the Vanguard’s presence drains opponents’ endurance, causing them to tire more quickly. **Stamina costs for actions increase by +3.**

### Lore

(#vanguard-lore)

#### The True Mark of a Vanguard: The Aura of the Summit

(#aura-of-the-summit)

- A genuine Vanguard of the Aegis doesn’t need to show their shard or markings to prove their title. Instead, they possess a unique ability to emit an aura—a deliberate manifestation of the Coldspire’s presence.

- When activated, this aura creates a heavy, almost crushing tension that mirrors the atmosphere of the #coldspire summit:
  - The sharpness of biting cold.
  - The weight of immense pressure, as though the mountain itself is pressing down (related: #legendary-aura).
  - The eerie stillness that demands both reverence and fear.

This aura cannot be replicated or faked. Even the most powerful illusionists fail to recreate the unique combination of sensations that define it. Those who experience it describe it as being in the presence of the mountain itself.

#### Vanguard's Core: A Gift from Coldspire

(#vanguard-core)

- Many impostors rely on forged shards to claim the title, but no one has seen the true shape and form of the Vanguard's Core, and only few even know it exists.

- The core amplifies the Vanguard's power or dampens it by channeling the mountain’s magic. It can't act as undeniable proof of status since no one can verify its authenticity from any other artifact that could come out of #coldspire. Only the Vanguard’s mastery and aura can truly verify their claim.

#### The Unseen Markings

(#vanguard-markings)

- Legends of markings exist, but no one truly knows their form.

- These markings, if real, are likely visible only during rare and intense moments—when the Vanguard channels the mountain’s full essence.

- This ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Vanguard, making it almost impossible for impostors to fabricate this part of the myth convincingly.

#### A Vanguard’s Magical Presence

(#vanguard-magical-presence)

- Above all, the Vanguard’s magical presence is their most defining feature. It is an unmistakable balance of power and control that reflects the trials they endured:
  - Unyielding like the red pillar of will.
  - Fluid yet purposeful like the blue pillar of adaptability.
  - Fearless like the green pillar of courage.
  - Steady like the yellow pillar of patience.
  - Piercingly precise like the violet pillar of focus.

This presence isn’t a deliberate display of strength but a natural, instinctive projection of their mastery over themselves and the mountain’s teachings. Even without activating their aura, those sensitive to magic feel the cold authority radiating from them—a mix of humility and overwhelming command.

#### Reflection on the Vanguard’s Identity

(#vanguard-identity)

By keeping the shard and markings exploitable while focusing on the aura and magical presence as the ultimate verification, Gatz’s journey as a Vanguard of the Aegis becomes deeply personal and impossible to fake. These elements reinforce the rarity and reverence of his title while maintaining the mystique of the #coldspire.

## Embersong 
(#embersong)

### Overview
- **Type**: Weapon (Phantom Blade, Coldspire Fragment)  
- **Source**: Forged from a fragment of Coldspire before Gatz’s final trial  
- **Tags**: #embersong, #coldspire-fragment, #phantom-blade, #flame-magic

## Shard of Stability
(#shard-of-stability)

### Overview
- **Type**: Artifact (Coldspire Relic)  
- **Source**: Coldspire Trials, attuned to the essence of balance and protection  
- **Tags**: #shard-of-stability, #coldspire-relic, #defensive-artifact, #resilience  

### Description
The Shard of Stability is a Coldspire artifact that embodies balance, protection, and resilience. Unlike other shards imbued with offensive or elemental power, this relic is inherently defensive and supportive. It generates stability amidst chaos, enhancing fortitude and mitigating disruptions—physical, emotional, or magical.  

Its polished surface gleams faintly with a calming energy, and its presence instills composure in both the wielder and nearby allies.  

### Features/Attributes (Optional)

| **Effect**               | **Details**                                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stabilizing Aura**     | Generates a calming field that mitigates external forces (e.g., wild magic surges, emotional influences). Grants bonuses to **Endurance** and **Situational Awareness** for allies nearby. |
| **Enhanced Protection**  | +4 to physical and magical defensive rolls. Amplifies defensive magic and barriers, increasing durability against piercing and elemental damage. Reduces stamina drain to 1 for all defensive actions (casting magic or shielding with equipment). |
| **Grounding Effect**     | Anchors the wielder during moments of imbalance (e.g., knockbacks, stagger, confusion). Reduces the impact of destabilizing effects. |

### Compatibility
- **Combat Use**:  
   - Enhances defensive barriers or magic, enabling prolonged endurance during chaotic battles.
- **Non-Combat Utility**:  
   - Mitigates disruptive external forces like wild magic or mental influence, ideal for exploration in unstable magical areas.  

### Stamina/Resource Cost
- **Cost to Use**:  
   - No cost to stamina and doesn't cause fatigue, but has 10 uses (applicable to 10 defensive rolls) each role-playing day.
- **Efficiency**:  
   - Highly efficient in chaotic scenarios, where maintaining balance and fortitude offsets resource drain.  

### Symbolism (Optional)
The Shard of Stability reflects the core philosophy of Coldspire: achieving balance amidst adversity. Its calming presence and defensive nature make it less about wielding raw power and more about protection, perseverance, and shielding others from harm.  

Gatz values it as a tool of purpose and composure, viewing it as a guardian’s artifact rather than a weapon of domination.

### Narrative/Role-Playing Notes (Optional)
- **Gift Potential**:  
   - A meaningful gift for someone struggling with emotional or magical instability, symbolizing protection and trust.  
- **Plot Hooks**:  
   - The shard’s calming aura could attract the attention of those seeking balance or make it a target for individuals desiring its protective power.

# Combat Rules 
(#combat-rules)

v1.3

## Mastery Level Modifiers

(#mastery-level-modifiers)

Each character’s mastery level in relevant skills adds a modifier to their rolls:

| **Mastery Level** | **Modifier** |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Novice             | +0           |
| Competent          | +1           |
| Adept              | +2           |
| Advanced           | +3           |
| Expert             | +4           |
| Elite              | +5           |
| Master             | +6           |

Modifiers apply to both offensive and defensive rolls based on relevant skills.

---

## Rolling for Offense and Defense

(#offense-and-defense)

Combat actions involve opposed rolls:

- **Attacker rolls**: Attack roll + offense modifier + bonus based on Attack Type selected.
- **Defender rolls**: Defense roll + defense modifier.

### Success Thresholds

(#success-thresholds)

- **Attack Hits**: If attack roll > defense roll.
  - *Example*: Attacker rolls 18; defender rolls 15. Attack hits.
- **Attack Blocked**: If defense roll ≥ attack roll.
  - *Example*: Attacker rolls 14; defender rolls 16. Attack blocked.

---

### Critical, Advantage and Disadvantage

(#critical-advantage-disadvantage, #critical)

- If defense roll exceeds attack roll by 10+, the defender gains advantage on their next offensive roll (counterattack opening).
- If attack roll exceeds defense roll by 10+, the attacker gains advantage on their next attack.

### Advantage Mechanics

(#advantage-mechanics, #advantage, #disadvantage)

- Roll twice and take the higher value.
- Triggered by:
  - A 2-level mastery difference in relevant skills.
  - A roll difference of 10+ (critical thresholds as described above).

## Fatigue and Stamina Calculation

(#fatigue-and-stamina-calculation)

### Stamina Formula

(#stamina-formula)

Based on endurance mastery level: `Stamina = 10 × (Mastery Index)^2`

### Mastery Index Values

(#mastery-index-values)

| **Mastery Level** | **Mastery Index** |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Novice             | 1                 |
| Competent          | 2                 |
| Adept              | 3                 |
| Advanced           | 4                 |
| Expert             | 5                 |
| Elite              | 6                 |
| Master             | 7                 |

For example, if a character has "Adept" Endurance skill mastery, their mastery index would be 3, and their stamina is calculated as `10 * (3)^2 = 90`

### Stamina Impact

(#stamina-impact, #exhaustion)

- When stamina **≤ 25%**, the character becomes **exhausted**:
  - Rolls suffer a **-2 penalty**.
  - Movement speed decreases.

## Damage Calculation

(#damage-calculation)

Damage is based on the roll difference between attacker and defender:

| **Roll Difference** | **Damage Type**   | **Damage Points** |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1-3                 | Glancing Damage   | 3                 |
| 4-9                 | Solid Damage      | 5                 |
| 10+                 | Critical Damage   | 10                |

The attacker’s roll must exceed the defender’s roll to deal damage. Damage is then deducted from stamina.

## Stability Rolls

(#stability-rolls)

When a character’s stamina drops to 0, they must roll for stability to stay conscious.

### Stability Roll

(#stability-roll-formula)

| **Condition**       | **Roll Formula**                |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| Stability Roll      | Roll 1d20 + Endurance Modifier |
| DC                  | 10 - (Offense Modifier - Defense Modifier) |

### Outcomes

(#stability-roll-outcomes)

- **Pass**: The character remains standing but loses their next action to recover.
- **Fail**: The character collapses and is out of combat.

## Types of Attacks

(#types-of-attacks)

Characters may choose attack types before rolling to adjust their strategy:

| **Attack Type**    | **Stamina Cost** | **Bonus to Roll** |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Quick Attack       | -2              | None              |
| Focused Attack     | -4              | +2                |
| Powerful Attack    | -6              | +4                |

If no attack type is declared, a Quick Attack is assumed.

## Types of Defense

(#types-of-defense)

| **Defense Type**      | **Stamina Cost** | **Bonus to Roll** |
|-----------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| (Default) Defense     | -1              | None              |
| Dodge                 | -1 (or 0)*      | None              |

*Dodge costs 0 stamina if the defender's speed mastery is at least one level above the attacker.

## Winning Conditions

(#winning-conditions)

Combat ends when:

- One character’s stamina is fully depleted, and they fail a stability roll.
- A specific win condition (e.g., “First to 3 hits”) is met.

# Combat Flow 

(#combat-flow)

v1.2

### **1. Initiative**

(#initiative)

- Roll `1d20` for all participants to determine combat order.
- Resolve ties using:
  - Higher relevant mastery level (e.g., Speed or Tactical Combat).
  - Secondary `1d20` roll if mastery is equal.
- Calculate initial stamina (fatigue capacity) using the stamina formula.

### **2. Declare Actions**

(#declare-actions)

- At the start of a combatant's turn, they declare their intended action:
  - **Offensive Actions**: Specify attack type.
  - **Defensive Actions**: Prepare to block or dodge an anticipated attack.
  - **Special Actions**: Cast a spell, activate an ability, or perform non-standard moves.

### **3. Check for Advantage**

(#check-for-advantage)

- Before rolling, determine if **advantage** applies:
  - Refer to Combat Rules [Rolling for Offense and Defense](#rolling-for-offense-and-defense) on what creates advantage or disadvantage.
  - If advantage applies, roll twice and take the higher result.

### **4. Roll for Action**

(#roll-for-action)

- **Offense**: Roll `1d20 + Offense Modifier(s)` (with advantage if applicable).
- **Defense**: Roll `1d20 + Defense Modifier(s)` (with advantage if applicable).
- **Special Actions**: Roll as determined by the nature of the action (e.g., a spell might require a specific roll type).

### **5. Compare Results and Determine Outcome**

(#compare-results-outcome)

- Compare offensive and defensive rolls:
  - **Attack Hits**: If `attack roll > defense roll`.
  - **Attack Blocked**: If `defense roll ≥ attack roll`.
- Calculate damage based on:
  - The roll difference (Glancing, Solid, or Critical Damage).
  - The chosen attack type.
- Update stamina for the defender if damage is dealt.

### **6. Apply Stamina Costs**

(#apply-stamina-costs)

- Deduct stamina costs for the chosen attack or defense actions:
  - Offensive stamina costs depend on attack type.
  - Defensive stamina costs depend on the chosen defense action.
- If stamina falls below **25%**, apply exhaustion penalties:
  - Rolls suffer a `-2 penalty`.
  - Movement speed decreases.

### **7. Check for New Advantage**

(#check-new-advantage)

- After determining results, check if a new advantage is triggered for the next round:
  - **Roll Difference (10+)**: The combatant with the higher roll gains advantage.
  - Apply this advantage to their next roll.

### **8. Stability Check (If Stamina Reaches 0)**

(#stability-check)

- If a combatant’s stamina drops to 0, they must roll for stability:
  - Roll `1d20 + Endurance Modifier` against `DC = 10 - (Opponent’s Offense Modifier - Defender’s Defense Modifier)`.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Pass**: The combatant remains standing but loses their next action.
  - **Fail**: The combatant collapses and is out of combat.

### **9. Apply Status Effects and Narrate**

(#apply-status-effects)

- Check for and apply any relevant status effects (e.g., stunned, fatigued, disoriented) triggered during the round.
- Narrate how the rolls play out.

### **10. Next Combatant**

(#next-combatant)

- End the current combatant’s turn and proceed to the next character in the initiative order.
- Repeat steps **2-9** for each combatant until the combat ends.
