## **Gatz’s Relationship with The Veil**

### **Recruitment**
- Gatz was approached by The Veil after his success in several critical missions that highlighted his tactical mind, integrity, and discipline.
- His skills, especially his situational awareness and fire magic, made him an ideal candidate for covert operations.

### **Involvement**
- Gatz’s role is primarily investigative and field-based, focusing on gathering intelligence, disrupting power imbalances, and recovering dangerous artifacts.
- Despite his association, Gatz is not fully integrated into The Veil’s inner circle, often operating on the periphery, carrying out tasks that align with their goals.

### **Tension with The Veil**
- Gatz respects The Veil’s mission but maintains skepticism about their secrecy and lack of transparency. He questions their motives and methods, though he recognizes their necessity in certain situations.
- His recent journey to Coldspire was a mission tied to The Veil, though the full scope of their intent regarding the mountain remains unclear to him.
