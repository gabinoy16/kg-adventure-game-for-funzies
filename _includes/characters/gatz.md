### Skill Mastery Calculations (aka. Leveling Up)
- Tags: #leveling-up, #calculating-experience, #experience

Here’s a table of cumulative "XP" (aka. "experience points") to reach each mastery level. XP requirements increase exponentially to reflect the increasing difficulty of achieving higher mastery levels. Lower levels are more accessible to provide early progress, while higher levels require extraordinary effort or major milestones.

| **Mastery Level**  | **Cumulative XP to Reach Level** | **Narrative Rationale** |
|---------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Novice**          | 0            | Starting point; little to no advantage.            |
| **Competent**       | 50           | Represents basic proficiency.                      |
| **Adept**           | 150          | A solid foundation with noticeable impact.         |
| **Advanced**        | 400          | Significant expertise with situational dominance.  |
| **Expert**          | 900          | High-level mastery, rare and impactful.            |
| **Elite**           | 2,000        | Unmatched skill that dominates most encounters; nearly peerless in their field. |
| **Master**          | 4,000        | Pinnacle of human expertise, near-perfect control and execution. |
| **Grand Master**    | 8,000        | Transcendent; a living legend capable of feats that redefine what is possible. |

How to calculate level up: Assign experience XP to specific types of events or actions taken during the day. XP is tied to action categories, making it easy to log and align with the narrative:
- Combat: Defeating enemies, surviving ambushes, or using creative tactics.
- Skill Use: Applying specific skills like Fire Magic, Tracking, or Tactical Combat.
- Exploration: Discovering new areas, uncovering secrets, or solving puzzles.
- Story Milestones: Completing key objectives, achieving character development moments, or making impactful decisions.

Examples:
- Small Event (e.g., defeating a minor foe): +10 XP.
- Moderate Event (e.g., defeating a boss or solving a significant puzzle): +25 XP.
- Major Event (e.g., Coldspire Trial or completing a chapter goal): +50 XP.

#### Calculating Experience for Gatz with the Vanguard’s Core Dampener

**Step 1**: Determine Base Experience Gain
- Tags: #base-experience-gain

Each cieli, experience gain for skills depends on the following factors:

1.1. Actions Taken:
   - Gatz must engage in activities relevant to the skill. For example:
     - Combat increases Martial Prowess, Tactical Combat, and Endurance.
     - Observational and investigative actions contribute to Situational Awareness.
     - Magic use influences Fire Magic.

1.2. Effort Intensity:
   - High-risk situations or extraordinary accomplishments (e.g., Coldspire trials) grant significant experience boosts compared to mundane tasks.

1.3. Cieli Activity Type:
   - Active combat or intense use: 3%-5% progression toward the next mastery level.
   - Training or moderate use: 1%-2% progression.
   - Passive activity: Minimal or no progression.

**Step 2**: Apply the Dampener
- Tags: #apply-dampener

The Vanguard’s Core dampens Gatz’s skills by three mastery levels for all except **Situational Awareness**. This introduces two effects:

2.1. Skill Cap:
   - Progression cannot exceed the dampened level’s maximum until the dampener is removed.
     - *Example*: A skill dampened to Competent will stop progressing once it reaches 100% toward Adept, even though the true level remains higher.

2.2. Experience Multiplier:
   - Training under the dampener boosts progression rates by **1.5x the base growth**.
     - This reflects the added difficulty of pushing against the seal.

**Step 3**: Update Mastery Levels After Each Cieli
- Tags: #update-mastery-levels

3.1. Calculate Dampened Progression:
   - Multiply the base growth percentage by **1.5x**.
     - *Example*: If Gatz earns 2% progress in **Martial Prowess** during a combat-heavy cieli, the effective gain with the dampener is 3%.

3.2. Apply Dampened Cap:
   - If the dampened cap is reached, progression is stockpiled but does not visibly increase until the dampener is removed.

3.3. Track True Progression:
   - Behind the scenes, add the actual experience earned to Gatz’s true mastery level.

#### Dampener Notes
- Tags: #dampener-notes

When Dampener is Removed:
  - The stored experience is applied immediately to the true skill levels, reflecting the hidden growth while training under the dampener.
Extraordinary Circumstances:
  - Unique trials or events (e.g., the Coldspire) grant larger progression boosts (e.g., 5%-10% base growth for elite feats). The dampener’s multiplier applies to these as well.

### Title: Vanguard of the Aegis

#### Passive Skill: "Legendary Aura: Unshakable Presence"
- Tags: #legendary-aura, #passive-skill, #unshakable-presence, #skill

This aura imposes the following effects on opponents whose relevant defensive mastery level is less than the Vanguard of the Aegis’ offensive mastery level:

| **Effect Name**       | **Roll Modifier**            | **Effect Description**                                                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fractured Will**     | -3 penalty to all rolls      | Opponents’ confidence and focus falter under the Vanguard’s overwhelming aura.                            |
| **Elemental Instability** | -3 penalty to elemental magic rolls | Opponents with elemental affinities experience unintended magical fluctuations, weakening spell control.    |
| **Weakened Stamina**   | +3 stamina cost per action   | The oppressive weight of the Vanguard’s presence drains opponents’ endurance, causing them to tire quickly.|

**The True Mark of a Vanguard: The Aura of the Summit**
- Tags: #aura-of-the-summit

A genuine Vanguard of the Aegis doesn’t need to show their shard or markings to prove their title. Instead, they possess a unique ability to emit an aura—a deliberate manifestation of the Coldspire’s presence. When activated, this aura creates a heavy, almost crushing tension that mirrors the atmosphere of the #coldspire summit:
  - The sharpness of biting cold.
  - The weight of immense pressure, as though the mountain itself is pressing down (related: #legendary-aura).
  - The eerie stillness that demands both reverence and fear.

This aura cannot be replicated or faked. Even the most powerful illusionists fail to recreate the unique combination of sensations that define it. Those who experience it describe it as being in the presence of the mountain itself.

**Vanguard's Core: A Gift from Coldspire**
- Tags: #vanguard-core

Many impostors rely on forged shards to claim the title, but no one has seen the true shape and form of the Vanguard's Core, and only few even know it exists. The core amplifies the Vanguard's power or dampens it by channeling the mountain’s magic. It can't act as undeniable proof of status since no one can verify its authenticity from any other artifact that could come out of #coldspire. Only the Vanguard’s mastery and aura can truly verify their claim.

**The Unseen Markings**
- Tags: #vanguard-markings

Legends of markings exist, but no one truly knows their form. These markings, if real, are likely visible only during rare and intense moments—when the Vanguard channels the mountain’s full essence. This ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Vanguard, making it almost impossible for impostors to fabricate this part of the myth convincingly.

**A Vanguard’s Magical Presence**
- Tags: #vanguard-magical-presence

Above all, the Vanguard’s magical presence is their most defining feature. It is an unmistakable balance of power and control that reflects the trials they endured:
  - Unyielding like the red pillar of will.
  - Fluid yet purposeful like the blue pillar of adaptability.
  - Fearless like the green pillar of courage.
  - Steady like the yellow pillar of patience.
  - Piercingly precise like the violet pillar of focus.
This presence isn’t a deliberate display of strength but a natural, instinctive projection of their mastery over themselves and the mountain’s teachings. Even without activating their aura, those sensitive to magic feel the cold authority radiating from them—a mix of humility and overwhelming command.

**Reflection on the Vanguard’s Identity**
- Tags: #vanguard-identity

By keeping the shard and markings exploitable while focusing on the aura and magical presence as the ultimate verification, Gatz’s journey as a Vanguard of the Aegis becomes deeply personal and impossible to fake. These elements reinforce the rarity and reverence of his title while maintaining the mystique of the #coldspire.
