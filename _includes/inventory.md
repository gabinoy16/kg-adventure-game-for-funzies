- Tags: #custom-shortsword, #blunt-weapon, #fire-magic-compatible, #dual-wield

### Overview
- **Type**: Weapon (Shortsword)  
- **Source**: Commissioned of the blacksmith of Eryndell to reflect Gatz’s philosophy and combat style  

### Description
Gatz’s custom shortsword is an intentionally blunt, wide, and unassuming weapon forged from high-quality matte-finished steel. It lacks the traditional sharp edge of combat swords, emphasizing its purpose as a tool of precision and restraint rather than wanton destruction. Without magical enhancement, it is effective as a blunt instrument for disabling foes rather than killing them outright.  

When paired with Gatz’s fire magic, the sword transforms into a blazing weapon, embodying his focus, control, and dual philosophy of balance and latent power.

- **Source**: Coldspire Trials, attuned to the essence of balance and protection    

### Description

It generates stability amidst chaos, enhancing fortitude and mitigating disruptions—physical, emotional, or magical. Its polished surface gleams faintly with a calming energy, and its presence instills composure in both the wielder and nearby allies.  

### Features/Attributes (Optional)
