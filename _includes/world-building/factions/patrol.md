## **Key Features of the Patrol**

### **Autonomy and Purpose**

- While they collaborate with local authorities, their mission often extends beyond city walls to include handling external threats like bandits, rogue factions, or wild magic.

### **Diverse Composition**
- Members include volunteers, adventurers, seasoned warriors, mages, and even scholars.
- Recruits are often trained in a mix of combat, tactics, and situational awareness, blending individual skills into cohesive units.
- Most members start as rookies but eventually develop into veterans or specialize in areas like reconnaissance, magic, or negotiation.

### **Ranking and Identification**
- While the Patrol has no formal ranking system, rookies wear distinct badges lacking the central star symbol found on veteran badges.
- Badges signify experience rather than hierarchical authority, fostering a merit-based culture.
- Medals or scars often serve as unofficial marks of respect or renown.
