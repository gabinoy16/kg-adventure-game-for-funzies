## World Date and Time (#world-date-and-time)
- Tags: #cieli, #septicieli, #rp-time, #date, #time

A "cieli" is a role-playing day -- shortened to "ci." A "septicieli" is a role-playing week -- shortened to "spc." 7 cieli = 1 septicieli The count runs from Spc. 1, Ci. 1 to Spc. 1, Ci. 7 before incrementing Spc to 2. Then it starts again at Spc. 1, Ci. 1.
Time is discussed in quarters not hours of the day.
- #first-quarter of the day is approximately midnight - sunrise (akin to 12:00 am - 6:00 am)
- #second-quarter of the day is approximately sunrise - noon (akin to 6:00 am - 12:00 pm)
- #third-quarter of the day is approximately noon - sunset (akin to to 6:00 am - 12:00 pm)
- #fourth-quarter of the day is approximately sunset - midnight (akin to to 6:00 pm - 12:00 am)
These make it more convenient to keep track of events throughout a cieli (role-playing day).

## Population Distribution
Achieving Elite mastery in any skill is a monumental feat, and someone with multiple Elite-level skills like Gatz is extraordinarily rare. Here’s an estimate of how rare Elite-level mastery is, particularly in the skills he possesses, based on the region’s population and the difficulty of achieving such mastery:

## Key Points for Gatz’s Skills
- Tags: #gatz-profile, #gatz-skills

- Martial Prowess:
   - Mastering martial combat to the Elite level requires exceptional discipline, years of training, and battlefield experience.
   - 1 in 10,000 fighters might reach this level, and fewer still can integrate the creativity and balance Gatz has demonstrated.

- Fire Magic:
   - Magic is already rare, with many practitioners failing to achieve true mastery due to its complexity and risks.
   - Elite-level fire magic is particularly scarce due to its volatile nature; perhaps 1 in 15,000 mages in your region could match your control and power.

- Tactical Combat:
   - Achieving Elite-level tactical combat mastery is highly specialized and even rarer than martial prowess or magic.
   - It combines intelligence, situational awareness, and experience. Fewer than 1 in 20,000 individuals could reach this level, particularly within the context of combat.

Gatz is in the top 0.01% of the population for his skill set, making him a once-in-a-generation talent in the region. His ability to balance fire magic, martial prowess, and tactical acumen sets him apart even further—perhaps only 1 in 100,000 individuals could claim a comparable combination of mastery. You’re not just rare; you’re one of the most skilled individuals the region has ever seen.

## Estimated Distribution of Skill Mastery in the Region

| **Mastery Level** | **Percentage of Population (All Skills)** | **Elite-Level for Gatz’s Skills** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Novice           | ~70% (most individuals remain here)    | ~90% never reach this level in combat or magic skills. |
| Competent        | ~20%                                   | ~8% have meaningful proficiency in a specialized skill. |
| Adept            | ~7%                                    | ~1.5% can demonstrate intermediate expertise. |
| Advanced         | ~2%                                    | ~0.4% achieve Advanced mastery in combat/magic skills. |
| Expert           | ~0.8%                                  | ~0.08% achieve Expert in combat/magic skills. |
| Elite            | ~0.1% (1 in 1,000)                     | ~0.01% (1 in 10,000) achieve Elite in martial prowess, fire magic, or tactical combat. |
| Master           | A select few, if not only a handful     | |

## Banking System
- Tags: #banking, #banking-system

The banking system in this world reflects a blend of practicality, trust, and innovation rooted in magical and logistical advancements. Here’s an overview of how the system works:

### Centralized Hubs and Regional Branches
- Major Banks: Banking institutions are often centered in large, trade-heavy cities such as Eryndell, which serve as financial hubs for entire regions.
- Regional Branches: Smaller cities and towns have branch offices connected to these hubs. These branches allow individuals to conduct transactions locally while still having access to the broader banking network.

### Banking Functions
- Currency Storage and Protection: Physical currency (gold, silver, and copper coins) is still widely used. Vaults in major banks are reinforced with both mundane and magical protections to prevent theft, even from skilled rogue factions like #the-syndicate.
- Ledgers and Accounts: Banks maintain meticulous ledgers that track deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. These are recorded both physically and through magically-enchanted tablets in central hubs, which communicate with other branches.
- Account Types: Standard Accounts: For everyday citizens, these accounts store wealth and facilitate secure transactions. Guild Accounts: Guilds and organizations can open pooled accounts to fund operations and pay members. Elite Accounts: Wealthy individuals, nobles, and the cities themselves often gain access to premium banking services, such as higher withdrawal limits and exclusive security measures.

### Secure Transfers
- Bank Seals: Individuals can deposit their funds in one branch and withdraw at another using magically-sealed tokens. These tokens hold encrypted information about the transaction, ensuring security. Tokens are one-time-use items and cannot be forged or intercepted without breaking the seal, which voids the transaction.
- Courier Networks: For larger transfers, banks hire couriers (often heavily guarded or magically enhanced) to physically move wealth between branches. These couriers are known as **Vaultrunners**.

### Magical Integration
- Enchanted Vaults: Vaults often feature enchantments that prevent unauthorized entry, such as runes that trigger alarms or traps. Some high-tier vaults can only be accessed with unique sigils attuned to their owner’s magic.
- Magical Tokens: Wealthier clients or guilds may store magical items, and these are cataloged with enchanted identification tags.
- Communication: Using magical "messenger stones," branches in the same network can instantly communicate critical financial information or verify transactions.

### The Banking Guild
Banks are often operated under the umbrella of a **Banking Guild**, a politically neutral organization that ensures consistency and trustworthiness.
The Banking Guild sets:
  - Exchange Rates: Standardized currency values between regions.
  - Regulations: Preventing fraud and ensuring fair practices.
  - Protections: Funding bounty hunters or mercenaries to eliminate threats like the Syndicate, which may target the banking network.

### Trust and Public Perception
Banking institutions are generally trusted but operate with caution. Some citizens, especially in smaller towns, distrust centralized banks and prefer to keep their wealth hidden or rely on barter systems.

### Notable Banking Practices
- Patronage Banking: Nobles or guild leaders may sponsor individuals to gain access to banking privileges, especially in smaller towns.
- Merchant Banks: Specialized banks focus on trade routes, offering insurance for caravans and ships.
- Magical Insurance: Clients can insure their stored items or coins against theft or magical disasters.

### Key Weaknesses
  - Bandits can still often target courier routes.
  - Enchanted seals and vaults, while robust, are not immune to skilled forgers or magical interference.
  - A disruption in magical systems, such as power fluctuations or artifact failures, could paralyze parts of the network.
