### Adventure Time v1.5 Log

#### Spc 4, Ci 7 (Current Cieli)

- **Updated Kael of The Veil**:
  - Gatz reported findings from Coldspire, including:
    - The abandoned syndicate base.
    - The map detailing syndicate operations and marked locations.
    - Observations about Coldspire’s volatile, magical materials.
  - Suggested a two-sided attack strategy: The Veil disrupts syndicate operations in Duskwatch Quarry and Glenhaven Docks while Gatz prepares to secure Coldspire.

- **Interaction with Master Harden (Blacksmith)**:
  - Gatz requested the shard from Coldspire (the Vanguard’s Core) be embedded into his armor for tactical use and as a strategic decoy.
  - Harden agreed to place the shard on the left chestplate, reinforced for durability.
  - Paid Harden in advance and left the armor for modification.

- **Training Session with Frey**:
  - Gatz guided Frey through her first real attempts at channeling lightning magic without her warding bracelet.
  - Frey’s results:
    - Initial attempt resulted in a shock pulse hitting Gatz, but he reassured her it was part of the process.
    - She successfully channeled a lightning bolt twice, showing measurable improvement in focus and control.
  - Gatz shared his philosophy of learning through balance, intent, and overcoming fear.
  - Frey felt the unique fatigue of magic use but gained confidence and resolve to keep improving.

- **Party Dynamics**:
  - Frey’s party celebrated her progress, with Gatz observing from a distance.
  - Gatz briefly reflected on the unusual toll of dampened Endurance as he quietly recovered.
  - Frey’s party members (Tharlin, Sorven, Araleth, and Veyren) demonstrated trust and growing cohesion as a team.

- **Community Mission Discussion**:
  - Gatz proposed taking on a community board mission to train further and earn coin.
  - Frey’s party agreed eagerly:
    - Tharlin and Sorven embraced it with their usual competitive banter.
    - Araleth saw it as an opportunity to grow outside controlled training.
    - Veyren expressed a desire to explore beyond the city walls.
  - Frey viewed the mission as a chance to fulfill their goal of proving themselves in a larger arena.

- **Sparring Match with Tharlin and Sorven**:
  - Gatz faced both twins in a 2v1 sparring match.
  - Results:
    - **Gatz**: Landed key hits on Sorven but took 4 total hits, yielding the match.
    - **Tharlin**: Delivered consistent, powerful strikes and remained unscathed.
    - **Sorven**: Took 2 hits but managed to land decisive blows alongside his brother.
  - Gatz reflected on the challenge of fighting while dampened, balancing fatigue with battle sense.
  - Commended the twins for their impressive teamwork and acknowledged their strength.

- **Preparation for the Mission**:
  - Gatz donned his old armor set:
    - A durable, flexible leather set with small, interconnected metallic trims.
    - Lightweight but heavier than mithril, offering less protection but excellent mobility.
    - The familiar weight brought back memories of years of use, despite the short time since the tournament.
  - Picked up a pouch of coins to shop for supplies at the apothecary.
  - Equipped his sword and cloak, leaving the cold-resistant coat hanging in the room.

- **Community Board Review**:
  - Gatz shortlisted potential missions suitable for Frey’s party:
    - **Dire Boar Herd Control**:
      - Cull aggressive dire boars in farmlands south of Eryndell (1.5 cieli away).
      - Reward: 10 coin per boar eliminated, bonus for dispersing the herd.
      - Risks: Boars are large, territorial, and travel in small groups.
    - **Harpy Nest Dispersal**:
      - Clear harpy nests near the cliffs of Stormwatch (2 cieli away).
      - Reward: Significant coin, bonus for harpy feathers.
      - Risks: Aerial combat and sonic screeches pose unique challenges.

  - After reviewing the board, Gatz noted the **Dire Boar Herd Control** mission might be especially appealing to the group for its scalable rewards and manageable terrain.
  - Realized a mount-drawn caravan could reduce travel time to 1 hour, making the mission logistics smoother.

#### Pending Actions:
- Finalize mission choice with Frey’s party at the community board.
- Consider hiring a caravan for efficient travel to the mission site.
