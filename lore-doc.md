## World Date and Time
- Tags: #cieli, #septicieli, #rp-time, #date, #time, #world-date-and-time

A "cieli" is a role-playing day -- shortened to "ci." A "septicieli" is a role-playing week -- shortened to "spc." 7 cieli = 1 septicieli The count runs from Spc. 1, Ci. 1 to Spc. 1, Ci. 7 before incrementing Spc to 2. Then it starts again at Spc. 1, Ci. 1.
Time is discussed in quarters not hours of the day.
- #first-quarter of the day is approximately midnight - sunrise (akin to 12:00 am - 6:00 am)
- #second-quarter of the day is approximately sunrise - noon (akin to 6:00 am - 12:00 pm)
- #third-quarter of the day is approximately noon - sunset (akin to to 6:00 am - 12:00 pm)
- #fourth-quarter of the day is approximately sunset - midnight (akin to to 6:00 pm - 12:00 am)
These make it more convenient to keep track of events throughout a cieli (role-playing day).

## Population Distribution
Achieving Elite mastery in any skill is a monumental feat, and someone with multiple Elite-level skills like Gatz is extraordinarily rare. Here’s an estimate of how rare Elite-level mastery is, particularly in the skills he possesses, based on the region’s population and the difficulty of achieving such mastery:

## Key Points for Gatz’s Skills
- Tags: #gatz-profile, #gatz-skills

- Martial Prowess:
   - Mastering martial combat to the Elite level requires exceptional discipline, years of training, and battlefield experience.
   - 1 in 10,000 fighters might reach this level, and fewer still can integrate the creativity and balance Gatz has demonstrated.

- Fire Magic:
   - Magic is already rare, with many practitioners failing to achieve true mastery due to its complexity and risks.
   - Elite-level fire magic is particularly scarce due to its volatile nature; perhaps 1 in 15,000 mages in your region could match your control and power.

- Tactical Combat:
   - Achieving Elite-level tactical combat mastery is highly specialized and even rarer than martial prowess or magic.
   - It combines intelligence, situational awareness, and experience. Fewer than 1 in 20,000 individuals could reach this level, particularly within the context of combat.

Gatz is in the top 0.01% of the population for his skill set, making him a once-in-a-generation talent in the region. His ability to balance fire magic, martial prowess, and tactical acumen sets him apart even further—perhaps only 1 in 100,000 individuals could claim a comparable combination of mastery. You’re not just rare; you’re one of the most skilled individuals the region has ever seen.

## Estimated Distribution of Skill Mastery in the Region

| **Mastery Level** | **Percentage of Population (All Skills)** | **Elite-Level for Gatz’s Skills** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Novice           | ~70% (most individuals remain here)    | ~90% never reach this level in combat or magic skills. |
| Competent        | ~20%                                   | ~8% have meaningful proficiency in a specialized skill. |
| Adept            | ~7%                                    | ~1.5% can demonstrate intermediate expertise. |
| Advanced         | ~2%                                    | ~0.4% achieve Advanced mastery in combat/magic skills. |
| Expert           | ~0.8%                                  | ~0.08% achieve Expert in combat/magic skills. |
| Elite            | ~0.1% (1 in 1,000)                     | ~0.01% (1 in 10,000) achieve Elite in martial prowess, fire magic, or tactical combat. |
| Master           | A select few, if not only a handful     | |

## Banking System
- Tags: #banking, #banking-system

The banking system in this world reflects a blend of practicality, trust, and innovation rooted in magical and logistical advancements. Here’s an overview of how the system works:

### Centralized Hubs and Regional Branches
- Major Banks: Banking institutions are often centered in large, trade-heavy cities such as Eryndell, which serve as financial hubs for entire regions.
- Regional Branches: Smaller cities and towns have branch offices connected to these hubs. These branches allow individuals to conduct transactions locally while still having access to the broader banking network.

### Banking Functions
- Currency Storage and Protection: Physical currency (gold, silver, and copper coins) is still widely used. Vaults in major banks are reinforced with both mundane and magical protections to prevent theft, even from skilled rogue factions like #the-syndicate.
- Ledgers and Accounts: Banks maintain meticulous ledgers that track deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. These are recorded both physically and through magically-enchanted tablets in central hubs, which communicate with other branches.
- Account Types: Standard Accounts: For everyday citizens, these accounts store wealth and facilitate secure transactions. Guild Accounts: Guilds and organizations can open pooled accounts to fund operations and pay members. Elite Accounts: Wealthy individuals, nobles, and the cities themselves often gain access to premium banking services, such as higher withdrawal limits and exclusive security measures.

### Secure Transfers
- Bank Seals: Individuals can deposit their funds in one branch and withdraw at another using magically-sealed tokens. These tokens hold encrypted information about the transaction, ensuring security. Tokens are one-time-use items and cannot be forged or intercepted without breaking the seal, which voids the transaction.
- Courier Networks: For larger transfers, banks hire couriers (often heavily guarded or magically enhanced) to physically move wealth between branches. These couriers are known as **Vaultrunners**.

### Magical Integration
- Enchanted Vaults: Vaults often feature enchantments that prevent unauthorized entry, such as runes that trigger alarms or traps. Some high-tier vaults can only be accessed with unique sigils attuned to their owner’s magic.
- Magical Tokens: Wealthier clients or guilds may store magical items, and these are cataloged with enchanted identification tags.
- Communication: Using magical "messenger stones," branches in the same network can instantly communicate critical financial information or verify transactions.

### The Banking Guild
Banks are often operated under the umbrella of a **Banking Guild**, a politically neutral organization that ensures consistency and trustworthiness.
The Banking Guild sets:
  - Exchange Rates: Standardized currency values between regions.
  - Regulations: Preventing fraud and ensuring fair practices.
  - Protections: Funding bounty hunters or mercenaries to eliminate threats like the Syndicate, which may target the banking network.

### Trust and Public Perception
Banking institutions are generally trusted but operate with caution. Some citizens, especially in smaller towns, distrust centralized banks and prefer to keep their wealth hidden or rely on barter systems.

### Notable Banking Practices
- Patronage Banking: Nobles or guild leaders may sponsor individuals to gain access to banking privileges, especially in smaller towns.
- Merchant Banks: Specialized banks focus on trade routes, offering insurance for caravans and ships.
- Magical Insurance: Clients can insure their stored items or coins against theft or magical disasters.

### Key Weaknesses
  - Bandits can still often target courier routes.
  - Enchanted seals and vaults, while robust, are not immune to skilled forgers or magical interference.
  - A disruption in magical systems, such as power fluctuations or artifact failures, could paralyze parts of the network.

### Coldspire Expedition Outcomes
- Tags: #coldspire-expedition

Gatz’s journey to Coldspire culminated in a legendary experience, both physically and spiritually, cementing his growth as one of the most exceptional warriors of his era. Below is a detailed summary of the outcomes and revelations from the expedition, including newfound powers, the role of the Vanguard’s Core, and the syndicate’s uncovered operations.

#### 1. Legendary Outcomes of the Coldspire Expedition

1.1 Completion of the Seven Trials
- Resilience and Sacrifice: Testing his physical endurance and ability to bear the burden for others.
- Control and Willpower: Forging his discipline through encounters with his doppelgänger, which mirrored his strengths and weaknesses.
- Balance and Harmony: Harmonizing with the mystical aspects of the mountain, gaining insight into the equilibrium between power and control.
- Adaptability and Strategy: Navigating difficult choices and challenges in both combat and exploration.
- These trials honed his mind, body, and spirit, leaving him as a Vanguard of the Aegis, a title bestowed upon mythically rare individuals who embody the mountain’s steadfastness, strength, and legacy.

1.2 The Vanguard’s Core
- Tags: #vanguard-core

At the conclusion of the trials, Coldspire presented Gatz with a shard known as the Vanguard’s Core, the last of its kind. This artifact represents the mountain’s unyielding power and purpose, and it serves as both a boon and a responsibility.

Powers of the Vanguard’s Core: Amplifies Gatz’s abilities but also acts as a dampener, allowing him to suppress his Legendary Aura and conceal his full potential.

The Legendary Aura: Unshakable Presence:
- Tags: #legendary-aura, #unshakable-presence, #skill

- Fractured Will: Opponents suffer a `-3 penalty` to rolls due to an oppressive weight on their confidence and resolve.
- Elemental Instability: Opponents with elemental magic experience `-3 penalties` to magical control rolls, disrupting their spells and abilities.
- Weakened Stamina: Opponents’ stamina costs increase by `+3 per action`, reflecting the Vanguard’s overwhelming presence.

1.3 The Fragment – Embersong
- Tags: #embersong

Before the final trial, Gatz forged a unique connection with a smaller fragment of Coldspire, which he now calls Embersong.
- Embersong’s Features:
  - Allows Gatz to channel his flame magic into a phantom blade of fire and crystal, acting as a secondary weapon.
  - Attuned to Gatz’s will, serving as a versatile tool for both offense and creativity in combat.

1.4 Increased Mastery and Hidden Growth
- Tags: #dampener, #dampened-skills

- Through the trials, Gatz achieved Elite mastery in Defensive Martial Prowess and Tactical Combat, and he improved other skills significantly.
- Using the Vanguard’s Core, Gatz has dampened his mastery levels by three tiers in all skills except Situational Awareness, to keep his powers hidden from those who might exploit or fear his capabilities.
- The dampener allows Gatz to train at a hidden growth rate of 1.5x experience gain, treating his suppressed skills like resistance training, where breaking through the imposed limits will result in greater growth over time.

#### 2. The Syndicate’s Operations and Map Discovery
- Tags: #syndicate-at-coldspire

While at Coldspire, Gatz uncovered an abandoned syndicate operation within the mountain, providing key insights into the group’s activities and goals.

2.1 Key Findings in the Syndicate Base
The Map: The map recovered at the abandoned base highlighted several circled locations across the region, revealing the syndicate’s areas of interest and potential operations. These include:
  - Eryndell Southern Market: A suspected black-market hub for crystal trafficking and other illicit trades.
  - Duskwatch Quarry: A mining site believed to be an attempted replica of the Coldspire crystal operations.
  - Glenhaven Docks: A shipping port marked for distribution of stolen artifacts and syndicate-controlled goods.
  - Stormcross Outpost: A remote hideout used as a staging ground for syndicate raids and meetings.
  - Eastern Veil Ruins: An old site believed to have ties to the mysterious organization known as The Veil.
Syndicate Crystals:
Gatz confiscated crystals from the syndicate’s courier and neutralized their power using a newfound ability tied to his role as Vanguard of the Aegis. These shards, while lesser than the Vanguard’s Core or Embersong, could have dangerous potential in the wrong hands.

2.2 The Syndicate’s Intentions
It’s clear that the syndicate was experimenting with Coldspire’s crystals, but their failures suggest they lack the deeper understanding required to harness them. Notes found in the base indicated plans to weaponize the crystals or sell them to the highest bidder, creating potential chaos in the region.

#### 3. Gatz’s Current Status and Path Forward

3.1 Concealing His Powers
Gatz has decided to keep the Vanguard’s Core and his Legendary Aura a secret, aware of the potential dangers they could attract. By using the dampener, he presents himself as a seasoned fighter rather than a mythic warrior, maintaining his anonymity while refining his true capabilities.

3.2 Next Steps in Eryndell
Having returned to Eryndell, Gatz now possesses critical intel on the syndicate’s operations. He plans to investigate the circled locations from the map to uncover the syndicate’s broader plans and dismantle their influence.

3.3 Reinforcements from Merrowyn
Gatz has hinted at returning to Merrowyn soon, potentially rallying allies or tapping into resources to combat the syndicate’s growing threat.

3.4 Personal Growth
The Coldspire expedition was transformative, not just for Gatz’s skills but for his understanding of his purpose. He now balances his humility with the responsibility of being a Vanguard of the Aegis, knowing his actions can shift the course of history.

### Syndicate Operations at Coldspire
You step closer to the map, careful not to disturb its placement. It’s pinned crudely against the rock wall, illuminated by the glow of nearby crystals. The parchment is marked with several key locations, each circled in varying colors. A closer look reveals distinct patterns in the markings:

1. Eryndell: Circled in red, likely marking it as a central hub. Notes scrawled beside it read, “Primary distribution center. Active shipments. Increased patrol presence.”
2. Shadewood Forest: Circled in green, with the note, “Supply route compromised. Alternative path required.”
3. Coldspire: Circled in blue, marked as “Resource Extraction - Crystal Veins. High yield. Limited success. Reinforcements requested.”
4. Valewatch Outpost: Circled in black, labeled as “Command Station. Secure. Overseer: Varrin.”
5. Unknown Site: An unmarked location near the coastline, circled in gold. No notes are written, but its position feels deliberate.

The map also includes a crude sketch of trade routes, with arrows connecting these locations. It’s clear that the syndicate’s operations span across multiple areas, each playing a distinct role in their broader network.

- Valewatch Outpost appears to be a key strategic base, possibly housing leadership or vital resources.
- The gold-circled site stands out as a mystery, its lack of notes suggesting it might be newly discovered or critical.
- The note about Shadewood’s compromised route aligns with your prior operations, suggesting you’ve already dealt them a significant setback there.
- Coldspire’s crystal veins seem to be a major focus, reinforcing your suspicion that their interest in the mountain is far from over.

### Current True Skill Levels and Dampened Levels 
- Tags: #true-skill-levels, #gatz-skill-mastery-levels, #gatz-mastery-levels

"Dampened Levels" refer to the effects of the Vanguard's Core #vanguard-core

| **Skill**                  | **True Level**           | **Dampened Level** | **Notes**                                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Skill Mastery Calculations (aka. Leveling Up)
- Tags: #leveling-up, #calculating-experience

#### Calculating Experience for Gatz with the Vanguard’s Core Dampener

**Step 1**: Determine Base Experience Gain
-Tags: #base-experience-gain

Each cieli, experience gain for skills depends on the following factors:

1.1. Actions Taken:
   - Gatz must engage in activities relevant to the skill. For example:
     - Combat increases Martial Prowess, Tactical Combat, and Endurance.
     - Observational and investigative actions contribute to Situational Awareness.
     - Magic use influences Fire Magic.

1.2. Effort Intensity:
   - High-risk situations or extraordinary accomplishments (e.g., Coldspire trials) grant significant experience boosts compared to mundane tasks.

1.3. Cieli Activity Type:
   - Active combat or intense use: 3%-5% progression toward the next mastery level.
   - Training or moderate use: 1%-2% progression.
   - Passive activity: Minimal or no progression.

**Step 2**: Apply the Dampener
- Tags: #apply-dampener

The Vanguard’s Core dampens Gatz’s skills by three mastery levels for all except **Situational Awareness**. This introduces two effects:

2.1. Skill Cap:
   - Progression cannot exceed the dampened level’s maximum until the dampener is removed.
     - *Example*: A skill dampened to Competent will stop progressing once it reaches 100% toward Adept, even though the true level remains higher.

2.2. Experience Multiplier:
   - Training under the dampener boosts progression rates by **1.5x the base growth**.
     - This reflects the added difficulty of pushing against the seal.

**Step 3**: Update Mastery Levels After Each Cieli
- Tags: #update-mastery-levels

3.1. Calculate Dampened Progression:
   - Multiply the base growth percentage by **1.5x**.
     - *Example*: If Gatz earns 2% progress in **Martial Prowess** during a combat-heavy cieli, the effective gain with the dampener is 3%.

3.2. Apply Dampened Cap:
   - If the dampened cap is reached, progression is stockpiled but does not visibly increase until the dampener is removed.

3.3. Track True Progression:
   - Behind the scenes, add the actual experience earned to Gatz’s true mastery level.

#### Dampener Notes
- Tags: #dampener-notes

When Dampener is Removed:
  - The stored experience is applied immediately to the true skill levels, reflecting the hidden growth while training under the dampener.
Extraordinary Circumstances:
  - Unique trials or events (e.g., the Coldspire) grant larger progression boosts (e.g., 5%-10% base growth for elite feats). The dampener’s multiplier applies to these as well.

### Title: Vanguard of the Aegis
- Tags: #vanguard-of-the-aegis, #vanguard-title, #coldspire-title

#### Passive Skill: "Legendary Aura: Unshakable Presence"
- Tags: #legendary-aura, #passive-skill, #unshakable-presence, #skill

This aura imposes the following effects on opponents whose relevant defensive mastery level is less than the Vanguard of the Aegis’ offensive mastery level:

| **Effect Name**       | **Roll Modifier**            | **Effect Description**                                                                                   |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Fractured Will**     | -3 penalty to all rolls      | Opponents’ confidence and focus falter under the Vanguard’s overwhelming aura.                            |
| **Elemental Instability** | -3 penalty to elemental magic rolls | Opponents with elemental affinities experience unintended magical fluctuations, weakening spell control.    |
| **Weakened Stamina**   | +3 stamina cost per action   | The oppressive weight of the Vanguard’s presence drains opponents’ endurance, causing them to tire quickly.|


#### Lore
- Tags: #vanguard-lore

**The True Mark of a Vanguard: The Aura of the Summit**
- Tags: #aura-of-the-summit

A genuine Vanguard of the Aegis doesn’t need to show their shard or markings to prove their title. Instead, they possess a unique ability to emit an aura—a deliberate manifestation of the Coldspire’s presence. When activated, this aura creates a heavy, almost crushing tension that mirrors the atmosphere of the #coldspire summit:
  - The sharpness of biting cold.
  - The weight of immense pressure, as though the mountain itself is pressing down (related: #legendary-aura).
  - The eerie stillness that demands both reverence and fear.

This aura cannot be replicated or faked. Even the most powerful illusionists fail to recreate the unique combination of sensations that define it. Those who experience it describe it as being in the presence of the mountain itself.

**Vanguard's Core: A Gift from Coldspire**
- Tags: #vanguard-core

Many impostors rely on forged shards to claim the title, but no one has seen the true shape and form of the Vanguard's Core, and only few even know it exists. The core amplifies the Vanguard's power or dampens it by channeling the mountain’s magic. It can't act as undeniable proof of status since no one can verify its authenticity from any other artifact that could come out of #coldspire. Only the Vanguard’s mastery and aura can truly verify their claim.

**The Unseen Markings**
- Tags: #vanguard-markings

Legends of markings exist, but no one truly knows their form. These markings, if real, are likely visible only during rare and intense moments—when the Vanguard channels the mountain’s full essence. This ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Vanguard, making it almost impossible for impostors to fabricate this part of the myth convincingly.

**A Vanguard’s Magical Presence**
- Tags: #vanguard-magical-presence

Above all, the Vanguard’s magical presence is their most defining feature. It is an unmistakable balance of power and control that reflects the trials they endured:
  - Unyielding like the red pillar of will.
  - Fluid yet purposeful like the blue pillar of adaptability.
  - Fearless like the green pillar of courage.
  - Steady like the yellow pillar of patience.
  - Piercingly precise like the violet pillar of focus.
This presence isn’t a deliberate display of strength but a natural, instinctive projection of their mastery over themselves and the mountain’s teachings. Even without activating their aura, those sensitive to magic feel the cold authority radiating from them—a mix of humility and overwhelming command.

**Reflection on the Vanguard’s Identity**
- Tags: #vanguard-identity

By keeping the shard and markings exploitable while focusing on the aura and magical presence as the ultimate verification, Gatz’s journey as a Vanguard of the Aegis becomes deeply personal and impossible to fake. These elements reinforce the rarity and reverence of his title while maintaining the mystique of the #coldspire.

- **Source**: Commissioned of the blacksmith of Eryndell to reflect Gatz’s philosophy and combat style  

### Description
Gatz’s custom shortsword is an intentionally blunt, wide, and unassuming weapon forged from high-quality matte-finished steel. It lacks the traditional sharp edge of combat swords, emphasizing its purpose as a tool of precision and restraint rather than wanton destruction. Without magical enhancement, it is effective as a blunt instrument for disabling foes rather than killing them outright.  

When paired with Gatz’s fire magic, the sword transforms into a blazing weapon, embodying his focus, control, and dual philosophy of balance and latent power.

### Features/Attributes (Optional)

The chipped matte finish and frost marks are not imperfections but **marks of perseverance**, representing Gatz’s trials in Coldspire and the reputation he continues to build. #mithril is also a rare material of the region and world. It's difficult to come by in great quantities, like enough to make into a full armor set, which is part of what made it an attractive and valuable tournament prize.

- **Source**: Coldspire Trials, attuned to the essence of balance and protection    

### Description
The Shard of Stability is a Coldspire artifact that embodies balance, protection, and resilience. Unlike other shards imbued with offensive or elemental power, this relic is inherently defensive and supportive. It generates stability amidst chaos, enhancing fortitude and mitigating disruptions—physical, emotional, or magical. Its polished surface gleams faintly with a calming energy, and its presence instills composure in both the wielder and nearby allies.  

### Features/Attributes (Optional)

|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Compatibility

- **Efficiency**: Highly efficient in chaotic scenarios, where maintaining balance and fortitude offsets resource drain.

The Shard of Stability reflects the core philosophy of Coldspire: achieving balance amidst adversity. Its calming presence and defensive nature make it less about wielding raw power and more about protection, perseverance, and shielding others from harm.
