## Current True Skill Levels and Dampened Levels 

(#true-skill-levels)  

"Dampened Levels" refer to the effects of the **Vanguard's Core**.

| **Skill**               | **True Level**           | **Dampened Level** | **Notes**                                                                        |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Endurance**           | Expert (65% → Elite)    | Competent          | Dampened three levels down; true growth continues at 1.5x multiplier.           |
| **Fire Magic**          | Expert (20% → Elite)    | Competent          | Dampened three levels down; hidden progress enhanced by 1.5x multiplier.        |
| **Martial Prowess**     | Elite (15% → Master)    | Adept              | Dampened three levels down; true growth continues at 1.5x multiplier.           |
| **Situational Awareness** | Expert (10% → Elite)   | Expert             | Not dampened; true growth unaffected.                                           |
| **Stealth**             | Expert (50% → Elite)    | Competent          | Dampened three levels down; hidden progress enhanced by 1.5x multiplier.        |
| **Tactical Combat**     | Elite (5% → Master)     | Adept              | Dampened three levels down; true growth continues at 1.5x multiplier.           |

## Skill Mastery Calculations (aka. Leveling Up)

(#leveling-up)  

### Calculating Experience for Gatz with the Vanguard’s Core Dampener

#### Step 1: Determine Base Experience Gain

(#base-experience-gain)  

Each cieli, experience gain for skills depends on the following factors:

1. **Actions Taken**:
   - Gatz must engage in activities relevant to the skill. For example:
     - Combat increases **Martial Prowess**, **Tactical Combat**, and **Endurance**.
     - Observational and investigative actions contribute to **Situational Awareness**.
     - Magic use influences **Fire Magic**.

2. **Effort Intensity**:
   - High-risk situations or extraordinary accomplishments (e.g., Coldspire trials) grant significant experience boosts compared to mundane tasks.

3. **Cieli Activity Type**:
   - **Active combat or intense use**: 3%-5% progression toward the next mastery level.
   - **Training or moderate use**: 1%-2% progression.
   - **Passive activity**: Minimal or no progression.

---

#### Step 2: Apply the Dampener

(#apply-dampener)  

The Vanguard’s Core dampens Gatz’s skills by three mastery levels for all except **Situational Awareness**. This introduces two effects:

1. **Skill Cap**:
   - Progression cannot exceed the dampened level’s maximum until the dampener is removed.
     - *Example*: A skill dampened to Competent will stop progressing once it reaches 100% toward Adept, even though the true level remains higher.

2. **Experience Multiplier**:
   - Training under the dampener boosts progression rates by **1.5x the base growth**.
     - This reflects the added difficulty of pushing against the seal.

---

#### Step 3: Update Mastery Levels After Each Cieli

(#update-mastery-levels)  

1. **Calculate Dampened Progression**:
   - Multiply the base growth percentage by **1.5x**.
     - *Example*: If Gatz earns 2% progress in **Martial Prowess** during a combat-heavy cieli, the effective gain with the dampener is 3%.

2. **Apply Dampened Cap**:
   - If the dampened cap is reached, progression is stockpiled but does not visibly increase until the dampener is removed.

3. **Track True Progression**:
   - Behind the scenes, add the actual experience earned to Gatz’s true mastery level.

---

### Dampener Notes

(#dampener-notes)  

- **When Dampener is Removed**:
  - The stored experience is applied immediately to the true skill levels, reflecting the hidden growth while training under the dampener.

- **Extraordinary Circumstances**:
  - Unique trials or events (e.g., the Coldspire) grant larger progression boosts (e.g., 5%-10% base growth for elite feats). The dampener’s multiplier applies to these as well.

## Title: Vanguard of the Aegis

(#vanguard-of-the-aegis, #vanguard-title, #coldspire-title)  

### Passive Skill: "Legendary Aura: Unshakable Presence"

(#legendary-aura, #passive-skill, #unshakable-presence, #skill)  

This aura imposes the following effects on opponents whose relevant defensive mastery level is less than the Vanguard of the Aegis’ offensive mastery level:

1. **Fractured Will**
   - Opponents suffer a **-3 penalty to all rolls** as their confidence and focus falter under the Vanguard’s overwhelming aura.

2. **Elemental Instability**
   - Opponents with elemental affinities experience **unintended magical fluctuations**, weakening their control over spells or imbuements. **Rolls involving elemental magic suffer a -3 penalty.**

3. **Weakened Stamina**
   - The oppressive weight of the Vanguard’s presence drains opponents’ endurance, causing them to tire more quickly. **Stamina costs for actions increase by +3.**

### Lore

(#vanguard-lore)

#### The True Mark of a Vanguard: The Aura of the Summit

(#aura-of-the-summit)

- A genuine Vanguard of the Aegis doesn’t need to show their shard or markings to prove their title. Instead, they possess a unique ability to emit an aura—a deliberate manifestation of the Coldspire’s presence.

- When activated, this aura creates a heavy, almost crushing tension that mirrors the atmosphere of the #coldspire summit:
  - The sharpness of biting cold.
  - The weight of immense pressure, as though the mountain itself is pressing down.
  - The eerie stillness that demands both reverence and fear.

This aura cannot be replicated or faked. Even the most powerful illusionists fail to recreate the unique combination of sensations that define it. Those who experience it describe it as being in the presence of the mountain itself.

#### The Shard: An Artifact with Limits

(#vanguard-shard-limits)

- Many impostors rely on forged shards to claim the title, but the shard is only a partial representation of the Vanguard.

- While the shard has its uses—amplifying power or channeling the mountain’s magic—it doesn’t act as undeniable proof of status. Only the Vanguard’s mastery and aura can truly verify their claim.

#### The Unseen Markings

(#vanguard-markings)

- Legends of markings exist, but no one truly knows their form.

- These markings, if real, are likely visible only during rare and intense moments—when the Vanguard channels the mountain’s full essence.

- This ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Vanguard, making it almost impossible for impostors to fabricate this part of the myth convincingly.

#### A Vanguard’s Magical Presence

(#vanguard-magical-presence)

- Above all, the Vanguard’s magical presence is their most defining feature. It is an unmistakable balance of power and control that reflects the trials they endured:
  - Unyielding like the red pillar of will.
  - Fluid yet purposeful like the blue pillar of adaptability.
  - Fearless like the green pillar of courage.
  - Steady like the yellow pillar of patience.
  - Piercingly precise like the violet pillar of focus.

This presence isn’t a deliberate display of strength but a natural, instinctive projection of their mastery over themselves and the mountain’s teachings. Even without activating their aura, those sensitive to magic feel the cold authority radiating from them—a mix of humility and overwhelming command.

#### Reflection on the Vanguard’s Identity

(#vanguard-identity)

By keeping the shard and markings exploitable while focusing on the aura and magical presence as the ultimate verification, Gatz’s journey as a Vanguard of the Aegis becomes deeply personal and impossible to fake. These elements reinforce the rarity and reverence of his title while maintaining the mystique of the #coldspire.
