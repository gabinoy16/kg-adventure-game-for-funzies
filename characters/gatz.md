## Skill Mastery Calculations (aka. Leveling Up)

### Calculating Experience for Gatz with the Vanguard’s Core Dampener

#### Step 1: Determine Base Experience Gain

Each cieli, experience gain for skills depends on the following factors:

1. **Actions Taken**:
   - Gatz must engage in activities relevant to the skill. For example:
     - Combat increases **Martial Prowess**, **Tactical Combat**, and **Endurance**.
     - Observational and investigative actions contribute to **Situational Awareness**.
     - Magic use influences **Fire Magic**.

2. **Effort Intensity**:
   - High-risk situations or extraordinary accomplishments (e.g., Coldspire trials) grant significant experience boosts compared to mundane tasks.

3. **Cieli Activity Type**:
   - **Active combat or intense use**: 3%-5% progression toward the next mastery level.
   - **Training or moderate use**: 1%-2% progression.
   - **Passive activity**: Minimal or no progression.

---

#### Step 2: Apply the Dampener

The Vanguard’s Core dampens Gatz’s skills by three mastery levels for all except **Situational Awareness**. This introduces two effects:

1. **Skill Cap**:
   - Progression cannot exceed the dampened level’s maximum until the dampener is removed.
     - *Example*: A skill dampened to Competent will stop progressing once it reaches 100% toward Adept, even though the true level remains higher.

2. **Experience Multiplier**:
   - Training under the dampener boosts progression rates by **1.5x the base growth**.
     - This reflects the added difficulty of pushing against the seal.

---

#### Step 3: Update Mastery Levels After Each Cieli

1. **Calculate Dampened Progression**:
   - Multiply the base growth percentage by **1.5x**.
     - *Example*: If Gatz earns 2% progress in **Martial Prowess** during a combat-heavy cieli, the effective gain with the dampener is 3%.

2. **Apply Dampened Cap**:
   - If the dampened cap is reached, progression is stockpiled but does not visibly increase until the dampener is removed.

3. **Track True Progression**:
   - Behind the scenes, add the actual experience earned to Gatz’s true mastery level.

---

### Final Notes

- **When Dampener is Removed**:
  - The stored experience is applied immediately to the true skill levels, reflecting the hidden growth while training under the dampener.

- **Extraordinary Circumstances**:
  - Unique trials or events (e.g., the Coldspire) grant larger progression boosts (e.g., 5%-10% base growth for elite feats). The dampener’s multiplier applies to these as well.
