## Shard of Stability

The Shard of Stability is a Coldspire artifact attuned to the essence of balance and protection. Unlike other shards with raw offensive or elemental power, this shard is inherently defensive and supportive. Its capabilities are rooted in maintaining stability amidst chaos, making it a unique tool for enhancing resilience and fortitude.

### Core Attributes

1. **Stabilizing Aura**:
   - Generates a calming field around the wielder, mitigating disruptive external forces (e.g., wild magic surges, emotional or mental influences).
   - Provides a bonus to **Endurance** and **Situational Awareness** for nearby allies during combat or perilous situations.

2. **Enhanced Protection**:
   - Amplifies defensive magic or barriers, increasing their durability and resistance to piercing or elemental damage.
   - When held or worn, the shard reduces the stamina drain of defensive actions, allowing for prolonged endurance in combat.

3. **Grounding Effect**:
   - Acts as an anchor during moments of imbalance, such as being physically or mentally disoriented.
   - Reduces the impact of destabilizing effects (e.g., knockbacks, stagger, or confusion-based attacks).

### Potential Applications

#### For Personal Use
- A reliable tool for maintaining composure and resilience in high-pressure scenarios.
- Can bolster defensive stances or techniques, synergizing with Gatz’s **Tactical Combat** and **Endurance**-focused abilities.

#### As a Gift
- Perfect for someone who struggles with stability in their life, whether it’s physical, emotional, or magical.
- Gatz sees it as a tool for protection rather than an instrument of power.
- A gift for an ally needing an extra layer of defense or someone facing uncontrollable forces in their journey.

The Shard of Stability embodies the balance Coldspire champions, making it an invaluable relic for shielding and perseverance.

## The Coldspire Fragment: "Embersong"

Before the final trial, Gatz forged a unique connection with a smaller fragment of Coldspire, which he now calls **Embersong**.

- Embersong allows Gatz to channel his flame magic into a phantom blade of fire and crystal, acting as a secondary weapon.
- It is attuned to Gatz’s will and serves as a versatile tool for both offense and creativity in combat.

### Effect: Bonuses or Perks of Manifesting the "Embersong" Blade

1. **Dual-Wield Advantage**:
   - Attacking with two blades grants Gatz an additional attack each round.
   - This second attack uses your standard offensive roll with a slight modifier for the phantom blade's amplified nature (**+1 to the attack roll** for the phantom blade).

2. **Enhanced Damage**:
   - The phantom blade's strikes deal **+2 additional damage** when they land, regardless of damage type (glancing, solid, critical).

3. **Energy Resonance**:
   - Any successful attack with the phantom blade briefly disorients the target, lowering their next defensive roll by **-1**.
   - This effect does not stack if you strike the same target multiple times with the phantom blade in the same round.

4. **Flexibility in Defense**:
   - The phantom blade can act as a defensive tool. If declared, it adds **+2 to your defense roll**, though you forgo its second attack that round.

5. **Stamina Cost**:
   - Maintaining the phantom blade will drain **5 stamina per round** of combat due to its demanding nature.

## Custom Shortsword

### Design
- Gatz's sword is intentionally blunt, wide, and unassuming in appearance. Its blade is forged from a high-quality but matte-finished steel, lacking the traditional sharp edge of most combat swords.
- Its design reflects Gatz's personal philosophy: the weapon is a tool of precision and purpose, not destruction or recklessness.
- Without his magic, the blade is more of a blunt instrument, effective for disabling rather than killing.

### Magic Compatibility
- When imbued with Gatz's **fire magic**, the sword undergoes a striking transformation:
  - A glowing, superheated blade of concentrated flame forms along its edges, giving it a lethal sharpness and unparalleled cutting power.
  - This flame is a physical manifestation of Gatz’s discipline and control, with an intensity that burns hotter depending on his focus.

### Symbolism
- The sword represents Gatz’s philosophy of balance—its unsharpened edge shows restraint, but its fiery transformation demonstrates the latent power of purpose and intent.

### Customization
- The hilt of the sword is ergonomically designed for ambidextrous use, a nod to Gatz's dual-wielding proficiency and preference for adaptability in combat.

## Mithril Armor

### Material
- Won at the Eryndell Tournament around Spc 3, Gatz's armor is forged from **mithril**, a rare, lightweight, and highly durable metal.
- It offers exceptional protection without compromising mobility, making it ideal for Gatz's versatile fighting style.

### Appearance
- The armor has a matte finish, designed to reduce reflections and provide a low-profile appearance during combat.
- The grueling trek up Coldspire caused the matte paint to chip, exposing mithril’s natural silvery sheen underneath. The gleaming patches are now visible reminders of his journey and victories.

### Customization
- The armor is tailored specifically to Gatz’s physique, allowing for maximum freedom of movement.
- The chest piece is reinforced with additional plates to protect vital areas, while the arms and legs are designed for agility, using overlapping mithril segments to maintain flexibility.
- The shoulder plates bear faint, almost imperceptible etchings of the Eryndell tournament crest, a mark of his victory and recognition by the city.

### Functionality
- The mithril provides resistance to both physical strikes and elemental attacks, such as fire and ice.
- Despite its durability, the armor remains light enough for Gatz to maneuver with ease, whether he's performing acrobatic movements or engaging in prolonged combat.

### Wear and Tear
- The Coldspire expedition left subtle marks on the armor, including minor scratches and signs of frost exposure. These marks serve as a testament to his trials and reinforce his growing reputation.
